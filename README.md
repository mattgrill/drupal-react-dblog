# React Admin UI

## Setup

Ensure you have a moderately recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (8.9.1LTS) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) installed. Currently the bundle is not included as this is under active development.

`cd js && yarn install && yarn run build:js`

## Development

The watcher will continuously build the bundle while you are working. 

`cd js && yarn install && yarn run watch:js`
